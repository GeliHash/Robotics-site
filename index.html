        <h2>Home Page: Introduction to Robotics and Its Application</h2>
        <p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that merges engineering,
            computer science, and technology to create machines capable of
            performing various tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These
            robots are often programmed to perform specific tasks, such as
            automating production lines, assisting in surgeries, or even
            exploring distant planets. Robotics has unlocked possibilities for
            industries, healthcare, exploration, and daily life, leading to
            innovations that leverage robust sensing and intelligent
            decision-making.</p>
        <p>In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, machine
            learning, and sensor technologies have greatly enhanced the
            capabilities of robots. They are no longer just machines following
            pre-programmed instructions but can now learn, adapt, and interact
            with their environment. From robotic arms in manufacturing to drones
            in agriculture, the world of robotics is rapidly evolving and has
            become a critical part of modern society.</p>

        <h2>Robots in Industry: Key Advancements in Industrial Automation</h2>
        <p>Robots are revolutionizing industrial sectors by automating processes
            that previously required human labor. The most common types of
            industrial robots include robotic arms, widely used in automotive,
            electronics, and consumer goods industries. These machines perform
            tasks with precision, speed, and endurance beyond human
            capabilities, such as welding, painting, assembling, and
            packaging.</p>
        <p>In addition to reducing production time and costs, industrial robots
            can work in hazardous environments where human safety might be at
            risk, such as handling toxic materials or operating in extreme
            conditions. As the demand for mass production grows, robots are
            becoming essential for maintaining efficient and error-free
            manufacturing. The future of industrial robots includes increased
            collaboration between robots and humans, with robots assisting
            workers in complex tasks requiring high-level decision-making.</p>

        <h2>Humanoid Robots: Overview of Humanoid Robots and Their
            Capabilities</h2>
        <p>Humanoid robots are designed to resemble and mimic human
            behavior, both in appearance and functionality. These robots can
            perform tasks traditionally reserved for humans, such as
            assisting in healthcare, customer service, and education. Their
            defining characteristic is the ability to interact with humans
            naturally and intuitively, using advanced algorithms for speech
            recognition, facial expression interpretation, and
            decision-making.F</p>
        <p>Some of the most well-known humanoid robots include ASIMO,
            Sophia, and Atlas, designed for purposes ranging from assisting
            the elderly and disabled to performing dangerous tasks in
            unstructured environments. Humanoid robots also play a key role
            in research, helping scientists study human cognition,
            biomechanics, and social interaction. With advancements in
            artificial intelligence and robotics, humanoid robots are
            expected to become more autonomous, capable of learning from
            experience and performing increasingly complex tasks.</p>
